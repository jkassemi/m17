Options Overview
Options Overview
Massive.com offers comprehensive historical U.S. options market data through convenient and accessible CSV Flat Files. Our datasets cover detailed trades, quotes, and aggregated market activity sourced directly from the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA), encompassing all 17 U.S. options exchanges. These structured, downloadable datasets streamline your access to extensive historical data, enabling efficient market analysis, strategy backtesting, risk management, and research without the complexity of handling numerous API calls.

Data Availability and Frequency
Options Flat Files are generated daily after the close of the full market session, capturing all trading activity from:

Regular Market Hours: Monday through Friday, 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET)
The finalized daily datasets become available for download by approximately 11:00 AM ET the following day. All timestamps in the datasets are provided as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch, UTC). When converting these timestamps into human-readable form (e.g., market open at 9:30 AM), remember they represent UTC time, not Eastern Time (ET). To correctly align data with market hours or dates, you'll need to explicitly convert timestamps from UTC to ET during your analysis.
